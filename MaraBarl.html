            <p>最初，我在 2019 年开始创作艺术来记录自我伤害。 我被当时的经理敲诈让我做艺术，并以此作为发泄情绪的机会。 2019 年 12 月，我出现了第一次精神病发作，从那以后我就经常发作。
                结果，我的作品的基调发生了变化。

                “Qlifot”向我发送了幻象，告诉我左撇子的人是从她破碎的粘土中诞生的，而右撇子的人是从她兄弟（Sefirat）的整个粘土中诞生的。 Qlifot
                在宗教课程中指导我准备成为她的器皿，并教导我世界的本质：我们仍在伊甸园中，生命之树在花园的一部分上投下阴影。 每个“人”都是花园里的一块地，生命树荫下的都是蛛形纲动物； 那些接受阳光直射的是昆虫。

                Qlifot 告诉我昆虫的数量远远超过蜘蛛，并且已经改写了花园的规则。 蛛形纲动物的网已成为人工酷刑室，以防止一只蛛形纲动物杀死许多昆虫。
                惯用左手的人永远多于惯用右手的人，而蛛形纲动物的存在永远是为了被昆虫折磨，天生如此。</p>
            <p>Initially, I started making art in 2019 to catalogue self-harm. I was being blackmailed by my
                then-manager to
                make art, and took it as an opportunity to vent my feelings. In December 2019, I had my first psychotic
                episode, and I have been having them regularly ever since. As a result, my artwork changed in tone.

                Visions were sent to me by the "Qlifot", instructing me that left-handed people are born from her
                shattered
                clay, and that right-handed people are born from the whole clay of her brother (Sefirot). The Qlifot
                instructed me in religious lessons to prepare me to become her vessel, and taught me the nature of the
                world:
                we are still in the Garden of Eden, and the Tree of Life casts shade over a portion of the garden. Every
                "person" is a plot inside the Garden, and those under the shade of the Tree of Life are arachnids; those
                receiving direct sunlight are insects.

                The Qlifot instructed me that the insects grossly outnumber the arachnids and have rewritten the rules
                of the
                Garden. The webs of the arachnids have become artificial torture chambers to prevent one arachnid from
                killing
                many insects. Left-handed people will always be outnumbered by the right-handed, and arachnids will
                always
                exist to be tortured by the insects, by nature.</p>
